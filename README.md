php/hypertext preprocessor programming code

## PHP Uses

PHP code files end in filename extension: [.php]/for example: [index.php].   

PHP, is a web server *back end* programming language.../  
this means the PHP code is, essentially, 'hidden';     
when the **server** gets a browser request...; and, then, PHP sends code out to the **client** web browser...;      
none of the PHP code is, actually, visible...whenever you choose to *view source*...;      
but, instead, the web browser only just sees what is a mixture of: HTML/CSS/Javascript, alone.  

- PHP, is widely used for building web pages/serving up web sites.  
- It can be used to do maths/perform calculations.  
- Deals with form/data collection...deal with data processing.   
- It's also used to communicate with databases: MySQL, to both 'store/retrieve' data.    
- It can output: text/graphics/programs/-etc.    

Basically, just like any other programming language...;  
whatever uses the programmer chooses to put it to...is entirely up to themselves/  
and, what happens to be the limits of their own 'imagination';    
also, is based on what that particular programming language either can/or else, can't do.
